//MAKE SURE TO READ THE COMMENTARY PER COMMAND

//IT IS RECOMMEND TO EXECUTE THIS ONLY ON THE MENU OR A SOLO SERVER AND NOT DURING INGAME.

// In ToppiOfficial's opinion is best to cap the fps about twice as the refresh rate of your monitor as pushing your frames to its max can cause fps jitter and stutter therefor only cap it what your twice the average fps (average of 60fps=120)(as there is no point capping like 300 if your rig can only handle like 80fps.
