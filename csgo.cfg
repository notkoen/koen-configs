//FPS Boost Config Authors:
//-> Koen (original creator and maintainer)
//-> ToppiOfficial (major overhaul and optimizations)

// put this in your csgo folder in steam/steamapps/common/Counter Strike: Global Offensive/csgo/cfg folder and name it autoexec.cfg
// put {+exec autoexec.cfg} in launch option
// it is recommended that you make a backup of your current config in case things dont work out

//several settings  are optional; just uncomment commands as you wish (MAKE SURE TO READ THE COMMENTARY PER COMMAND)
//IT IS RECOMMEND TO EXECUTE THIS ONLY ON THE MENU OR A SOLO SERVER AND NOT DURING INGAME.

// In ToppiOfficial's opinion is best to cap the fps about twice as the refresh rate of your monitor as pushing your frames to its max can cause fps jitter and stutter therefor only cap it what your twice the average fps (average of 60fps=120)(as there is no point capping like 300 if your rig can only handle like 80fps.
