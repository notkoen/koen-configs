// Insurgency (Source) FPS Boost Config by Koen

cl_smooth 0 //Smooths out the difference between the clients prediction of your view and the server. Makes being on a high ping server nicer at the expense of putting you at an extra disadvantage.
cl_ejectbrass 0 //Shows first person shell casings if on.
cl_ejectbrass_3p 0 //“Show brass ejection particle effect and model in 3rd person”
cl_blurTapSize 0 //Default is 0.5; idk
cl_forcepreload 1 //Forces the game to load the entire map upfront to avoid stuttering caused by loading the map on the fly. If you have crashes consider turning this off.
cl_ragdoll_maxcount 10 //Default is 25; min is 10 “Clients will only show this many ragdolls”
cl_show_splashes 0

mat_clipz 0
mat_hbao 0 //”Enables HBAO rendering” Horizontal Based Abient Occlusion, it creates shadows based on geometry.
mat_antialias 0 //NOINFO
mat_compressedtextures 1 //If “0” the source engine will use uncompressed textures for the current map. Will INCREASE LOADING TIMES and total RAM use, but will reduce on-the-fly load on the CPU.
mat_queue_mode -1 //Default is -1; Setting it to 2 will improve performance on many multicore CPUs. Set to “-1” if you lack it or are unsure. “-1” uses the default for your system, “0” uses synchronous single thread, “1” uses queued single threaded mode, and value of “2” uses multi-threaded mode.
mat_mipmaptextures 1 //Mipmaps increase the quality of far away textures. Turning this off will make the game look worse.

mat_picmip 2 //Sets the texture quality; min is “0 max is “2”; “2” is lowest quality, “0” is highest quality. Can cause a crash if changing this in-game or if it conflicts with in-game settings. Using sv_cheats you can set it between “-10.000000” and “4”.

mat_bumpmap 0 //Turns bumpmap rendering on and off. Essentially adds fake depth using a 2D texture.

mat_parallaxmap 0 //Turns parallax mapping on and off. Related to bump mapping, parallax mapping creates fake depth using an illusion of 3D.
mat_reduceparticles 1 //probably reduces particles
mat_reducefillrate 1 //probably reduces fill rate
mat_specular 0 //”0″ will disable specularity, “1” will leave it as is.
mat_fastspecular 1 //LEAVE ON. NO PERFORMANCE INCREASE IF OFF. Visually disables specular reflections while still rendering them. No effect on preformance. Only useful for comparing differences.
mat_colcorrection_disableentities 1 //“Disables map color-correction entities”
mat_motion_blur_enabled 0 //Ensures motion blur for materials is off.
mat_forceaniso 0 //Sets Anistropic Filtering Level; “0” = bilinear, “1” = trilinear, “2” = 2X, “4” = 4X, “8” = 8X, “16” = 16X,
//mat_hdr_enabled //Seems to either enable HDR or say if it is on or off.
mat_hdr_level 0 //”Set to 0 for no HDR, 1 for LDR+bloom on HDR maps, and 2 for full HDR on HDR maps”

//mat_max_worldmesh_vertices //Be careful when changing this variable. It can cause crashes.

mat_phong 0 //Setting this to “0” will disable phong, a sort of fancy lighting.
//mat_scope_fancy 0 //Leave unused so your scope isn’t blurry. A scope with a low-detail dot will make shooting tougher.
mat_disable_fancy_blending 1
mat_colcorrection_disableentities 1 //“Disable map color-correction entities”
mat_triplebuffered 0 May enable triple buffering if you are fullscreen and using vsync.
mat_filtertextures 1 //Smooths textures. Textures will appear blocky if this is off. Will NOT improve preformance!
mat_filterlightmaps 1 //Smooths lightmaps. Lighting will appear blocky if this is off. Will NOT improve preformance!

//mem_max_heapsize 2048 //Default is 512; Amount of RAM for the game to use, adjust to your system accordingly or delete it to be safe. Set to a clean multiple of 8. “Maximum amount of memory to dedicate to engine hunk and datacache (in mb)”
muzzleflash_light 1 //Doesn’t do anything as far as I know. Setting it to “0” used to disable muzzle flash from your own gun in CSGO. May not work anymore.

r_ambientboost 0 //“Set to boost ambient term if it is totally swamped by local lights”

decalfrequency 10 //Default is 10; The frequency that bullet impacts, or other decal makers, will make a decal. Seems to be a percentage.
